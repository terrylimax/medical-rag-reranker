**Question**

Who is at risk for Parasites - Taeniasis? ?

**Answer**

People at risk for taeniasis include those who eat raw or undercooked beef or pork. Specifically, individuals in under-developed communities with poor sanitation, as well as those in regions where contaminated raw beef or pork is consumed, such as Eastern Europe, Russia, eastern Africa, Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, India, and Asia, are at higher risk. In the United States, taeniasis is more common among Latin American immigrants, particularly those who consume raw or undercooked pork or beef [medquad_ans_0000397-2\_\_dup1][medquad_ans_0000397-1__dup2]. Additionally, people with poor hygiene who have taeniasis may shed tapeworm eggs in their feces, potentially contaminating their environment and increasing the risk of transmission to themselves or others [medquad_ans_0000397-2\_\_dup1

## Example 6

**Query ID:** `0000450-4`

**Question**

Is hemophilia inherited ?

**Answer**

Yes, hemophilia is inherited. Hemophilia A and hemophilia B are inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern, meaning the genes associated with these conditions are located on the X chromosome [medquad_ans_0000450-4]. In males, who have only one X chromosome, one altered copy of the gene is sufficient to cause the condition. In females, who have two X chromosomes, a mutation would need to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder, making it very rare for females to have hemophilia [medquad_ans_0000450-4]. The condition can be passed from mother to child, with carrier females having a 50% chance of passing the gene to their children [medquad_ans_0000069-3__dup1]. In some cases, mutations can occur randomly in the gene as it is passed to a child, even if

## Example 8

**Query ID:** `0000775-1`

**Question**

What is (are) paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria ?

**Answer**

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired disorder that leads to the premature death and impaired production of blood cells. It affects red blood cells (erythrocytes), which carry oxygen; white blood cells (leukocytes), which protect the body from infection; and platelets (thrombocytes), which are involved in blood clotting. The disorder is characterized by sudden, recurring episodes of symptoms (paroxysmal symptoms) that may be triggered by stresses on the body, such as infections or physical exertion. During these episodes, red blood cells are prematurely destroyed (hemolysis), leading to a deficiency of red blood cells (hemolytic anemia) and resulting in signs and symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, abnormally pale skin (pallor), shortness of breath, and an increased heart rate. Affected individuals may pass dark-colored urine due to the presence of hemoglobin, a

**Question**

What is (are) junctional epidermolysis bullosa ?

**Answer**

Junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB) is a type of Epidermolysis Bullosa, a group of genetic conditions that cause the skin to be very fragile and to blister easily. JEB is separated into two categories: the Herlitz type and the Non-Herlitz type. The Herlitz type is very severe, with blistering present from birth or early infancy, affecting large regions of the body and mucous membranes, leading to complications such as chronic malnutrition, scarring, granulation tissue formation, and increased susceptibility to infections. Many infants with Herlitz JEB do not survive beyond the first year of life. The Non-Herlitz type includes several subtypes that cause mild to severe blistering, often limited to the hands, feet, knees, and elbows, and may improve after the newborn period. JEB is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern and is caused by

**Query ID:** `0000756-1`

**Question**

What is (are) ornithine translocase deficiency ?

**Answer**

Ornithine translocase deficiency is an inherited disorder that causes ammonia to accumulate in the blood. Ammonia, which is formed when proteins are broken down in the body, is toxic if the levels become too high. The nervous system is especially sensitive to the effects of excess ammonia. Ornithine translocase deficiency varies widely in its severity and age of onset. An infant with ornithine translocase deficiency may be lacking in energy (lethargic) or refuse to eat, or have poorly controlled breathing or body temperature. Some babies with this disorder may experience seizures or unusual body movements, or go into a coma. Episodes of illness may coincide with the introduction of high-protein formulas or solid foods into the diet. In most affected individuals, signs and symptoms of ornithine translocase deficiency do not appear until later in life. Later-onset forms of ornithine translocase deficiency are usually less severe than the

What is (are) Henoch-Schonlein purpura ?

**Answer**

Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) is a disease that involves purple spots on the skin (purpura), joint pain, digestive problems, and glomerulonephritis (a type of kidney disorder). It may develop as an immune response to an infection, though the exact cause is not fully understood. HSP is usually seen in children, but it may affect people of any age. Most cases go away on their own without treatment, and the main goal of treatment, when needed, is to relieve symptoms such as joint pain, abdominal pain, or swelling. In some patients with severe arthritis, prednisone, a steroid medicine, may be prescribed. The primary symptom is a rash that looks like many small raised bruises, caused by inflammation and leakage from small blood vessels in the body. HSP can also affect the kidneys, digestive tract, and joints. Most people recover completely, though kidney damage is the most likely

**Question**

What are the genetic changes related to Senior-Lken syndrome ?

**Answer**

The genetic changes related to Senior-Lken syndrome are mutations in one of at least five genes. These mutations are believed to affect proteins involved in the structure and function of cilia, which are important for cell signaling and sensory perception. However, it remains unclear how these defects specifically lead to nephronophthisis and Leber congenital amaurosis. In some individuals, no mutations in these known genes are identified, and the genetic cause of the disorder is unknown [medquad_ans_0000896-3].

Do you have information about Genetic Testing

**Answer**

Yes, information about genetic testing is available for certain conditions. For hereditary sensory neuropathy type 1 (HSN1), at least four genes have been identified (HSN1A, HSN1B, HSN1C, HSN1D, HSN1E), and the Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) provides information about genetic testing for HSN1A. However, clinical laboratories offering testing for other types of HSN1 are not currently known, and patients should consult a health care provider or genetics professional to locate testing options [medquad_ans_0002853-4].

For congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD), GeneTests lists laboratories performing genetic testing, though most do not accept direct contact from patients; patients should work with a health care provider or genetics professional to access testing [medquad_ans_0001483-5].

What is (are) capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation syndrome ?

**Answer**

Capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation syndrome (CM-AVM) is a disorder of the vascular system characterized by capillary malformations (CMs), which are composed of enlarged capillaries that increase blood flow near the surface of the skin. These malformations appear as multiple small, round, pink or red spots on the skin, typically on the face, arms, and legs, and may be visible at birth or during childhood. While capillary malformations alone usually do not cause health problems, some individuals with CM-AVM also have more serious vascular abnormalities such as arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs), which are abnormal connections between arteries, veins, and capillaries. These abnormalities can lead to complications including abnormal bleeding, migraine headaches, seizures, and heart failure, some of which can be life-threatening. Complications of AVMs and AV

Treatment for diverticular disease depends on how serious the problem is and whether you are suffering from diverticulosis or diverticulitis. Most people get better by changing their diet. If you have rectal bleeding, you need to go to the hospital so a doctor can find the part of your colon that is bleeding. The doctor may use a special drug that makes the bleeding stop. The doctor may also decide to operate and remove the part of the colon that is bleeding. Eating a high-fiber diet can help prevent problems and reduce symptoms. Recommended high-fiber foods include fruit (raw apples, peaches, pears, and tangerines), vegetables (fresh broccoli, squash, carrots, and brussels sprouts), starchy vegetables (potatoes, baked beans, kidney beans, and lima beans), and grains (whole-wheat bread, brown rice, bran flake cereal, and oatmeal).

What is (are) Hashimoto thyroiditis ?

**Answer**

Hashimoto thyroiditis is a condition that affects the function of the thyroid, a butterfly-shaped gland in the lower neck. It is a form of chronic inflammation that can damage the thyroid, reducing its ability to produce hormones. In Hashimoto thyroiditis, the immune system attacks the thyroid gland, causing inflammation and interfering with its ability to produce thyroid hormones. This immune attack is due to an autoimmune response where large numbers of white blood cells called lymphocytes accumulate in the thyroid and produce antibodies that initiate the autoimmune process. One of the first signs of Hashimoto thyroiditis is an enlargement of the thyroid called a goiter. Hashimoto thyroiditis is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in the United States [medquad_ans_0000005-1\_\_dup5][medquad_ans_0000448-1].

Wolman disease is a rare inherited condition involving the breakdown and use of fats and cholesterol in the body (lipid metabolism). It is a type of lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the LIPA gene and inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The condition leads to a buildup of lipids in body organs such as the spleen, liver, bone marrow, small intestine, adrenal glands, and lymph nodes, along with calcium deposits in the adrenal glands. Infants are often healthy at birth but soon develop symptoms including enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), poor weight gain, low muscle tone, jaundice, vomiting, diarrhea, developmental delay, anemia, and poor nutrient absorption.

What are the genetic changes related to microphthalmia ?

**Answer**

Genetic changes related to microphthalmia include mutations in many genes involved in the early development of the eye, most of which have not been identified. The condition may also result from chromosomal abnormalities affecting one or more genes. In the case of Lenz microphthalmia syndrome, mutations in at least two genes on the X chromosome are thought to be responsible, with only the BCOR gene currently identified. The BCOR gene provides instructions for making the BCL6 corepressor protein, which helps regulate the activity of other genes and appears to play an important role in early embryonic development. A mutation in the BCOR gene changes the structure of the BCL6 corepressor protein, disrupting normal eye and organ development before birth [medquad_ans_0000593-3].
