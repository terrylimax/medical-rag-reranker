**Question**

Is early-onset primary dystonia inherited ?

**Answer**

Yes, early-onset primary dystonia can be inherited. Mutations in the TOR1A gene are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one of the two copies of the gene is altered in each cell. Only 30 to 40 percent of people who inherit a TOR1A mutation will ever develop signs and symptoms of early-onset primary dystonia [medquad_ans_0000312-4]. Everyone who has been diagnosed with early-onset primary dystonia has inherited a mutation in this gene [medquad_ans_0000312-4].

**Question**

Is hemophilia inherited ?

**Answer**

Yes, hemophilia is inherited. It is usually inherited through genes located on the X chromosomes, and individuals are born with the disorder due to a defect in the genes that determine how the body makes blood clotting factor VIII or IX [medquad_ans_0000069-1__dup3]. Males are more commonly affected because they have only one X chromosome, so if that X chromosome carries the hemophilia gene, they will have the disorder. Females with the gene on one X chromosome are typically carriers and can pass the gene to their children [medquad_ans_0000069-1__dup3].

**Question**

What is (are) paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria ?

**Answer**

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is an acquired disorder that leads to the premature death and impaired production of blood cells, affecting red blood cells (erythrocytes), white blood cells (leukocytes), and platelets (thrombocytes). It is characterized by sudden, recurring episodes of symptoms (paroxysmal symptoms) that may be triggered by stresses such as infections or physical exertion. During these episodes, red blood cells are prematurely destroyed (hemolysis), leading to hemoglobinuria—dark-colored urine due to the presence of hemoglobin. This condition can cause hemolytic anemia, resulting in symptoms like fatigue, weakness, pallor, shortness of breath, and increased heart rate. Individuals are also at risk for infections due to white blood cell deficiency, abnormal blood clotting (thrombosis), especially in large abdominal veins, or severe bleeding (hemorrhage). Additionally, people with this disorder are

**Question**

What is (are) junctional epidermolysis bullosa ?

**Answer**

Junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB) is a type of epidermolysis bullosa, a group of genetic conditions that cause the skin to be very fragile and to blister easily. JEB is separated into two categories: the Herlitz type and the Non-Herlitz type. The Herlitz type is very severe and individuals with this condition often do not survive infancy. The Non-Herlitz type includes several subtypes that cause mild to severe blistering of the skin present at birth or shortly thereafter. JEB is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern and is caused by mutations in the LAMB3, COL17A1, or LAMC2, and LAMA3 genes. Mutations in each of these genes can cause Herlitz JEB or non-Herlitz JEB, with LAMB3 gene mutations being the most common, causing about 70

**Question**

What is (are) ornithine translocase deficiency ?

**Answer**

Ornithine translocase deficiency is an inherited disorder that causes ammonia to accumulate in the blood. Ammonia, which is formed when proteins are broken down in the body, is toxic if the levels become too high. The nervous system is especially sensitive to the effects of excess ammonia. Ornithine translocase deficiency varies widely in its severity and age of onset. An infant with ornithine translocase deficiency may be lacking in energy (lethargic) or refuse to eat, or have poorly controlled breathing or body temperature. Some babies with this disorder may experience seizures or unusual body movements, or go into a coma. Episodes of illness may coincide with the introduction of high-protein formulas or solid foods into the diet. In most affected individuals, signs and symptoms of ornithine translocase deficiency do not appear until later in life. Later-onset forms of ornithine translocase deficiency are usually less severe than the

**Question**

What are the genetic changes related to Senior-Lken syndrome ?

**Answer**

Genetic changes related to Senior-Lken syndrome include mutations in one of at least five genes. These genes are known or suspected to play roles in cell structures called cilia, which are involved in signaling pathways between cells. Mutations in these genes likely lead to problems with the structure and function of cilia, disrupting important chemical signaling pathways within cells. However, it remains unclear how these defects specifically lead to nephronophthisis and Leber congenital amaurosis. In some cases, individuals with Senior-Lken syndrome do not have identified mutations in these five genes, and the genetic cause in those cases is unknown [medquad_ans_0000896-3].

Do you have information about Genetic Testing

**Answer**

Yes, information about genetic testing for spinocerebellar ataxia type 11 is available. Genetic testing of adults who do not have any symptoms but are at-risk of having inherited the mutation is possible. However, testing is not useful in predicting age of onset, severity, type of symptoms, or rate of progression in individuals who do not have any symptoms. The affected family member should be tested first to confirm the molecular diagnosis in the family. For detailed information on testing, inheritance, and genetic counseling, including a comprehensive review of spinocerebellar ataxia type 11, the GeneReviews website provides current, evidence-based information [medquad_ans_0005761-3].

What is (are) capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation syndrome ?

**Answer**

Capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation syndrome (CM-AVM) is a disorder of the vascular system characterized by capillary malformations (CMs), which are composed of enlarged capillaries that increase blood flow near the surface of the skin. These malformations appear as multiple small, round, pink or red spots on the skin, typically on the face, arms, and legs, and may be visible at birth or during childhood. While capillary malformations alone usually do not cause health problems, some individuals with CM-AVM also have more serious vascular abnormalities such as arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs), which are abnormal connections between arteries, veins, and capillaries affecting blood circulation. These abnormalities can lead to complications including abnormal bleeding, migraine headaches, seizures, and heart failure, some of which can be life-threatening. Complications of AVM

Is hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer inherited ?

**Answer**

Yes, hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC) is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means that having one mutated copy of the gene in each cell is enough to cause symptoms of the condition. In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutated copy of the gene from an affected parent. Other cases result from new mutations in the gene that occur for the first time in the affected individual. When an individual with an autosomal dominant condition has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) risk to inherit the mutated gene [medquad_ans_0002833-4].

What is (are) Neutral lipid storage disease with myopathy ?

**Answer**

Neutral lipid storage disease with myopathy is a rare condition in which fats (lipids) are stored abnormally in organs and tissues throughout the body. This abnormal accumulation leads to muscle weakness (myopathy) due to fat buildup in muscle tissue. Other possible features include a fatty liver, weakened and enlarged heart (cardiomyopathy), inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), reduced thyroid activity (hypothyroidism), and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The condition is caused by mutations in the PNPLA2 gene, which results in impaired function of the adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) enzyme, leading to the inability to break down triglycerides properly and their subsequent accumulation. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, and there is currently no treatment to correct the underlying metabolic problem. Management focuses on dietary guidelines and symptom-related treatments, with recent studies suggesting potential benefit from bezafibrate for lipid accumulation and

Attacks often occur at night and can be triggered by stressful events, alcohol, or drugs. Early attacks usually subside within 3 to 10 days, even without treatment [medquad_ans_0000409-1__dup1]. Gout frequently affects joints in the lower part of the body such as the ankles, heels, knees, or toes, and often first attacks the big toe [medquad_ans_0000028-1__dup4].
