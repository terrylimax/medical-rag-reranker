## Example 8

**Query ID:** `0000775-1`

**Question**

What is (are) paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria ?

**Answer**

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is an acquired disorder that leads to the premature death and impaired production of blood cells. It affects red blood cells (erythrocytes), which carry oxygen; white blood cells (leukocytes), which protect the body from infection; and platelets (thrombocytes), which are involved in blood clotting. The disorder is characterized by sudden, recurring episodes of symptoms (paroxysmal symptoms) that may be triggered by stresses on the body, such as infections or physical exertion. During these episodes, red blood cells are prematurely destroyed (hemolysis), leading to hemoglobinuria—dark-colored urine due to the presence of hemoglobin. In many cases, hemoglobinuria is most noticeable in the morning. The premature destruction of red blood cells results in hemolytic anemia, causing symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, pallor, shortness of breath, and an increased heart rate.

**Question**

What is (are) junctional epidermolysis bullosa ?

**Answer**

Junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB) is one of the major forms of epidermolysis bullosa, a group of genetic conditions that cause the skin to be very fragile and to blister easily. Blisters and skin erosions form in response to minor injury or friction, such as rubbing or scratching. Researchers classify JEB into two main types: Herlitz JEB and non-Herlitz JEB. Although the types differ in severity, their features overlap significantly, and they can be caused by mutations in the same genes. Herlitz JEB is the more severe form of the condition. From birth or early infancy, affected individuals have blistering over large regions of the body. Blistering also affects the mucous membranes, such as the moist lining of the mouth and digestive tract, which can make it difficult to eat and digest food. As a result, many affected children have chronic malnutrition

## Example 12

**Query ID:** `0000756-1`

**Question**

What is (are) ornithine translocase deficiency ?

**Answer**

Ornithine translocase deficiency is an inherited disorder caused by mutations in the SLC25A15 gene, which results in a defective mitochondrial ornithine transporter. This transporter is responsible for moving ornithine across the inner membrane of mitochondria to the mitochondrial matrix, where it participates in the urea cycle. When the transporter is unstable or misshapen, ornithine cannot reach the matrix, leading to a disruption of the urea cycle. As a result, ammonia accumulates in the blood because the body cannot effectively process excess nitrogen from protein breakdown. Ammonia is toxic, especially to the nervous system, and its buildup causes symptoms such as lethargy, poor feeding, seizures, abnormal movements, coma, vomiting, ataxia, confusion, and blurred vision. The disorder varies in severity and age of onset, with infantile forms being more severe and later-onset forms typically less severe. Individuals may also

Mollaret meningitis is a rare type of meningitis characterized by repeated episodes of fever, stiff neck (meningismus), muscle aches, and severe headaches, separated by weeks or months of no symptoms. About half of affected individuals may also experience long-term abnormalities of the nervous system that come and go, such as seizures, double vision, abnormal reflexes, paralysis of a cranial nerve (paresis), hallucinations, or coma. The exact cause remains unknown, although recent data suggests that herpes simplex virus (HSV-2 and, less frequently, HSV-1) may cause some, if not most cases. Other potential causes include trauma and viral infections other than herpes simplex [medquad_ans_0004105-1]. The symptoms of Mollaret meningitis are similar to those of other types of meningitis and include high fever, severe headache, nausea, vomiting, stiff neck, photophobia, and

**Answer**

Genetic changes related to Senior-Lken syndrome include mutations in one of at least five genes. The proteins produced from these genes are known or suspected to play roles in cell structures called cilia, which are involved in signaling pathways between cells. Mutations in these genes likely lead to problems with the structure and function of cilia, disrupting important chemical signaling pathways within cells [medquad_ans_0000896-3]. However, it remains unclear how these defects specifically lead to nephronophthisis and Leber congenital amaurosis. In some individuals, no mutations in these five known genes are identified, and the genetic cause of the disorder is therefore unknown [medquad_ans_0000896-3].

**Question**

Do you have information about Genetic Testing

**Answer**

Yes, information about genetic testing for spinocerebellar ataxia type 11 is available. Genetic testing of adults who do not have any symptoms but are at-risk of having inherited the mutation is possible. However, testing is not useful in predicting age of onset, severity, type of symptoms, or rate of progression in individuals who do not have any symptoms. The affected family member should be tested first to confirm the molecular diagnosis in the family. For detailed information on testing, inheritance, and genetic counseling, including a comprehensive review of spinocerebellar ataxia type 11, the GeneReviews website provides current, evidence-based information [medquad_ans_0005761-3]. Additionally, the Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) offers information about genetic tests, though it is intended for healthcare providers and researchers [medquad_ans_0005761-3].

What is (are) capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation syndrome ?

**Answer**

Capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation syndrome (CM-AVM) is a disorder of the vascular system, which is the body's complex network of blood vessels. It is characterized by capillary malformations (CMs), which are composed of enlarged capillaries that increase blood flow near the surface of the skin. These malformations appear as multiple small, round, pink or red spots on the skin, commonly on the face [medquad_ans_0000149-1]. CM-AVM is also associated with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), which are abnormal connections between arteries and veins that can lead to complications such as abnormal bleeding and heart failure. CM-AVM and some cases of Parkes Weber syndrome share the same genetic cause [medquad_ans_0000772-1]. Resources for diagnosis and management of CM-AVM include genetic testing, diagnostic tests,

What is (are) Neutral lipid storage disease with myopathy ?

**Answer**

Neutral lipid storage disease with myopathy is a rare condition in which fats (lipids) are stored abnormally in organs and tissues throughout the body. People with this condition have muscle weakness (myopathy) due to the accumulation of fats in muscle tissue. Other features may include a fatty liver, a weakened and enlarged heart (cardiomyopathy), inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), reduced thyroid activity (hypothyroidism), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (the most common form of diabetes). The condition is caused by mutations in the PNPLA2 gene, which leads to impaired function of the adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) enzyme, resulting in the inability to break down triglycerides and their subsequent accumulation in muscle and tissues. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations, and each parent carries one copy of the mutated gene without showing

What is (are) Hashimoto thyroiditis ?

**Answer**

Hashimoto thyroiditis is a condition that affects the function of the thyroid, a butterfly-shaped gland in the lower neck. It is classified as an autoimmune disorder, meaning the immune system attacks the body's own tissues and organs. In people with Hashimoto thyroiditis, white blood cells called lymphocytes accumulate abnormally in the thyroid, leading to damage of thyroid cells. These lymphocytes produce immune system proteins called antibodies that attack and destroy thyroid cells. When too many thyroid cells are damaged or die, the thyroid can no longer produce enough hormones to regulate body functions, resulting in hypothyroidism. However, some individuals with thyroid antibodies never develop hypothyroidism or experience symptoms. The condition is thought to result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors, with genetic variations in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex and other immune-regulating genes being studied as possible risk factors. Most of these genetic variations have a small impact on overall risk. Environmental

What is (are) Wolman disease ?

**Answer**

Wolman disease is a rare inherited condition involving the breakdown and use of fats and cholesterol in the body (lipid metabolism). It is a type of lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the LIPA gene, which provides instructions for producing an enzyme called lysosomal acid lipase. This enzyme is essential for processing lipids such as cholesteryl esters and triglycerides in lysosomes, where they are broken down and recycled. Mutations in the LIPA gene lead to a shortage of lysosomal acid lipase, resulting in the accumulation of triglycerides, cholesteryl esters, and other fats within cells and tissues. This accumulation, along with malnutrition due to the body's inability to use lipids properly, causes the signs and symptoms of Wolman disease [medquad_ans_0001043-1][medquad_ans_0006463-1][medquad_ans_0

What are the genetic changes related to microphthalmia ?

**Answer**

The genetic changes related to microphthalmia in Lenz microphthalmia syndrome involve mutations in at least two genes on the X chromosome. Only one of these genes, BCOR, has been identified. The BCOR gene provides instructions for making a protein called the BCL6 corepressor, which helps regulate the activity of other genes and plays an important role in early embryonic development. A mutation in the BCOR gene changes the structure of the BCL6 corepressor protein, disrupting normal development of the eyes and other organs and tissues before birth [medquad_ans_0000593-3].
