**Question**

Who is at risk for Parasites - Taeniasis? ?

**Answer**

People at risk for taeniasis include those who eat raw or undercooked beef or pork. Infections with Taenia saginata occur where contaminated raw beef is consumed, particularly in Eastern Europe, Russia, eastern Africa, and Latin America. Taenia solium infections are more common in underdeveloped communities with poor sanitation and where raw or undercooked pork is consumed, with higher rates seen in Latin America, Eastern Europe, sub-Saharan Africa, India, and Asia. Taenia solium taeniasis is also seen in the United States, typically among Latin American immigrants. Taenia asiatica is limited to Asia and is found in the Republic of Korea, China, Taiwan, Indonesia, and Thailand. Persons who do not eat raw or undercooked beef or pork are not likely to get taeniasis [medquad_ans_0000397-2__dup1].

**Query ID:** `0000775-1`

**Question**

What is (are) paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria ?

**Answer**

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is an acquired disorder that leads to the premature death and impaired production of blood cells. It affects red blood cells (erythrocytes), which carry oxygen; white blood cells (leukocytes), which protect the body from infection; and platelets (thrombocytes), which are involved in blood clotting. The disorder affects both sexes equally and can occur at any age, although it is most often diagnosed in young adulthood. People with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria experience sudden, recurring episodes of symptoms (paroxysmal symptoms) that may be triggered by stresses on the body, such as infections or physical exertion. During these episodes, red blood cells are prematurely destroyed (hemolysis), leading to hemoglobinuria—dark-colored urine due to the presence of hemoglobin. In many cases, hemoglobinuria is most noticeable in the morning. The premature destruction of red blood cells

**Question**

What is (are) junctional epidermolysis bullosa ?

**Answer**

Junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB) is one of the major forms of epidermolysis bullosa, a group of genetic conditions that cause the skin to be very fragile and to blister easily. Blisters and skin erosions form in response to minor injury or friction, such as rubbing or scratching. Researchers classify JEB into two main types: Herlitz JEB and non-Herlitz JEB. Although the types differ in severity, their features overlap significantly, and they can be caused by mutations in the same genes. Herlitz JEB is the more severe form of the condition, with blistering occurring from birth or early infancy [medquad_ans_0000544-1]. Both types of JEB are rare, affecting fewer than 1 per million people in the United States, and are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern [medquad_ans_00

## Example 12

**Query ID:** `0000756-1`

**Question**

What is (are) ornithine translocase deficiency ?

**Answer**

Ornithine translocase deficiency is an inherited disorder caused by mutations in the SLC25A15 gene, which results in a defective mitochondrial ornithine transporter. This transporter is responsible for moving ornithine across the inner membrane of mitochondria to the mitochondrial matrix, where it participates in the urea cycle. When the transporter is unstable or misshapen, ornithine cannot reach the matrix, leading to a disruption of the urea cycle. As a result, ammonia accumulates in the blood because the body cannot effectively process excess nitrogen from protein breakdown. Ammonia is toxic, especially to the nervous system, and its buildup causes symptoms such as lethargy, poor feeding, seizures, abnormal movements, coma, vomiting, ataxia, confusion, and blurred vision. The disorder varies in severity and age of onset, with infantile forms being more severe and later-onset forms typically less severe. Individuals may also

What is (are) Mollaret meningitis ?

**Answer**

Mollaret meningitis is a rare type of meningitis characterized by repeated episodes of fever, stiff neck (meningismus), muscle aches, and severe headaches, separated by weeks or months of no symptoms. About half of affected individuals may also experience long-term abnormalities of the nervous system that come and go, such as seizures, double vision, abnormal reflexes, paralysis of a cranial nerve (paresis), hallucinations, or coma. The exact cause remains unknown, although recent data suggests that herpes simplex virus (HSV-2 and, less frequently, HSV-1) may cause some, if not most cases. Other potential causes include trauma and viral infections other than herpes simplex [medquad_ans_0004105-1]. The symptoms of Mollaret meningitis are the same as those found in other types of meningitis, including high fever, severe headache, nausea, vomiting, stiff neck, photophobia

Genetic changes related to Senior-Lken syndrome include mutations in one of at least five genes. The proteins produced from these genes are known or suspected to play roles in cell structures called cilia, which are involved in signaling pathways between cells. Mutations in these genes likely lead to problems with the structure and function of cilia, disrupting important chemical signaling pathways. However, it remains unclear how these defects specifically lead to nephronophthisis and Leber congenital amaurosis. Some individuals with Senior-Lken syndrome do not have identified mutations in these five genes, and in such cases, the genetic cause is unknown [medquad_ans_0000896-3].

Do you have information about Genetic Testing

**Answer**

Yes, information about genetic testing for spinocerebellar ataxia type 11 is available. Genetic testing of adults who do not have any symptoms but are at-risk of having inherited the mutation is possible. However, testing is not useful in predicting age of onset, severity, type of symptoms, or rate of progression in individuals who do not have any symptoms. The affected family member should be tested first to confirm the molecular diagnosis in the family. For detailed information on testing, inheritance, and genetic counseling, including a comprehensive review of spinocerebellar ataxia type 11, the GeneReviews website provides current, evidence-based information [medquad_ans_0005761-3].

What is (are) capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation syndrome ?

**Answer**

Capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation syndrome (CM-AVM) is a disorder of the vascular system, characterized by capillary malformations (CMs), which are composed of enlarged capillaries that increase blood flow near the surface of the skin. These malformations typically appear as multiple small, round, pink or red spots on the skin, often on the face [medquad_ans_0000149-1]. CM-AVM is also associated with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), which are abnormal connections between arteries and veins that can lead to complications such as abnormal bleeding and heart failure. The syndrome shares a genetic cause with some cases of Parkes Weber syndrome [medquad_ans_0000772-1]. Resources for diagnosis and management of CM-AVM include genetic testing, genetic counseling, and other interventions such as diagnostic tests, drug therapy, surgery and rehabilitation

Neutral lipid storage disease with myopathy is a condition in which fats (lipids) are stored abnormally in organs and tissues throughout the body. People with this condition have muscle weakness (myopathy) due to the accumulation of fats in muscle tissue. Other features may include a fatty liver, a weakened and enlarged heart (cardiomyopathy), inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), reduced thyroid activity (hypothyroidism), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (the most common form of diabetes). The condition is caused by mutations in the PNPLA2 gene, which impair the function of the adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) enzyme, leading to a failure in breaking down triglycerides and their subsequent accumulation in tissues [medquad_ans_0004401-3].

The illness associated with Zika virus infection is usually mild, with common symptoms including fever, rash, joint pain, and conjunctivitis (red eyes). Recent research has suggested a link between Zika virus infection and Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), and prenatal infection has been shown to cause adverse pregnancy outcomes such as microcephaly and other serious brain anomalies. There is no vaccine or specific medicine to treat Zika virus; management includes rest, hydration, and use of acetaminophen for pain, with avoidance of aspirin and NSAIDs until dengue is ruled out.

What is (are) Hashimoto thyroiditis ?

**Answer**

Hashimoto thyroiditis is a condition that affects the function of the thyroid, a butterfly-shaped gland in the lower neck. It is classified as an autoimmune disorder, in which the immune system attacks the body's own tissues and organs. In people with Hashimoto thyroiditis, white blood cells called lymphocytes accumulate abnormally in the thyroid, leading to damage of thyroid cells. These lymphocytes produce immune system proteins called antibodies that attack and destroy thyroid cells. When too many thyroid cells are damaged or die, the thyroid can no longer produce enough hormones to regulate body functions, resulting in hypothyroidism. However, some individuals with thyroid antibodies never develop hypothyroidism or experience symptoms. The condition is thought to result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors, with genetic variations in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex and other immune-regulating genes being associated with increased risk, though most have a small individual impact.

What is (are) Wolman disease ?

**Answer**

Wolman disease is a rare inherited condition involving the breakdown and use of fats and cholesterol in the body (lipid metabolism). It is a type of lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the LIPA gene, which leads to a deficiency of lysosomal acid lipase. This enzyme is responsible for processing lipids such as cholesteryl esters and triglycerides within lysosomes. Due to the enzyme deficiency, harmful amounts of lipids accumulate in organs and tissues, including the spleen, liver, bone marrow, small intestine, adrenal glands, and lymph nodes. Additionally, calcium deposits are seen in the adrenal glands. Infants are typically healthy at birth but soon develop symptoms such as hepatosplenomegaly, poor weight gain, low muscle tone, jaundice, vomiting, diarrhea, developmental delay, anemia, and poor nutrient absorption. The disease is severe and life-threatening, with most affected children not surviving past early childhood.
