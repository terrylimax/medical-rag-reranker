**Question**

Is early-onset primary dystonia inherited ?

**Answer**

Yes, early-onset primary dystonia is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder [medquad_ans_0000342-4]. Mutations in the TOR1A gene, which is associated with this condition, are inherited in this manner [medquad_ans_0000312-4]. In most cases, an affected person has one parent with the condition, and individuals who inherit the altered gene may or may not show signs or symptoms [medquad_ans_0001013-4].

**Question**

What is (are) paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria ?

**Answer**

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is an acquired disorder that leads to the premature death and impaired production of blood cells, affecting red blood cells (erythrocytes), white blood cells (leukocytes), and platelets (thrombocytes). It is characterized by sudden, recurring episodes of symptoms (paroxysmal symptoms) that may be triggered by stresses such as infections or physical exertion. During these episodes, red blood cells are prematurely destroyed (hemolysis), leading to hemoglobinuria—dark-colored urine due to the presence of hemoglobin. This condition can cause hemolytic anemia, resulting in symptoms like fatigue, weakness, pallor, shortness of breath, and increased heart rate. Individuals are also at risk for infections due to white blood cell deficiency, abnormal blood clotting (thrombosis), especially in large abdominal veins, or severe bleeding (hemorrhage). Additionally, people with this disorder are

Colorectal cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the colon or the rectum. The colon and rectum are parts of the large intestine, which is part of the digestive system. Colorectal cancer occurs when malignant tumors form in the lining of the large intestine, also called the large bowel. Cancer that begins in the colon is called colon cancer, and cancer that begins in the rectum is called rectal cancer. Cancer that begins in either of these organs may also be called colorectal cancer [medquad_ans_0000037_4-1, medquad_ans_0000010-10].

**Question**

What is (are) junctional epidermolysis bullosa ?

**Answer**

Junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB) is one of the major forms of epidermolysis bullosa, a group of genetic conditions that cause the skin to be very fragile and to blister easily. Blisters and skin erosions form in response to minor injury or friction, such as rubbing or scratching. Researchers classify JEB into two main types: Herlitz JEB and non-Herlitz JEB. Although the types differ in severity, their features overlap significantly, and they can be caused by mutations in the same genes. Herlitz JEB is the more severe form, with blistering present from birth or early infancy over large regions of the body and affecting mucous membranes, leading to difficulties with eating and digestion, chronic malnutrition, scarring, granulation tissue formation, and potential respiratory complications. Infants with Herlitz JEB usually do not survive beyond the first year of life.

**Question**

What are the genetic changes related to molybdenum cofactor deficiency ?

**Answer**

The genetic changes related to molybdenum cofactor deficiency are mutations in the MOCS1, MOCS2, or GPHN gene. Mutations in the MOCS1 gene cause type A, mutations in the MOCS2 gene cause type B, and mutations in the GPHN gene cause type C of the disorder [medquad_ans_0000668-3]. These mutations reduce or eliminate the function of the associated protein, impairing molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis [medquad_ans_0000668-3]. In rare cases, an individual may inherit two mutated copies of the MOCS1 gene through uniparental isodisomy, a mechanism where the child receives two copies of the mutated gene from one parent due to an error in egg or sperm cell formation [medquad_ans_0000668-4].

**Query ID:** `0000756-1`

**Question**

What is (are) ornithine translocase deficiency ?

**Answer**

Ornithine translocase deficiency is an inherited disorder caused by mutations in the SLC25A15 gene, which results in a defective mitochondrial ornithine transporter. This transporter is essential for moving ornithine across the inner membrane of mitochondria to the mitochondrial matrix, where it participates in the urea cycle. When the transporter is unstable or misshapen, ornithine cannot reach the matrix, disrupting the urea cycle. As a result, ammonia accumulates in the blood, which is toxic, especially to the nervous system. The disorder varies in severity and age of onset; infantile forms may present with lethargy, feeding difficulties, poor temperature regulation, seizures, or coma, while later-onset forms are usually less severe and may involve intolerance to high-protein foods, leading to episodes of vomiting, lethargy, ataxia, confusion, or blurred vision. Complications may include developmental delay, learning

Mollaret meningitis is a rare type of meningitis characterized by repeated episodes of fever, stiff neck (meningismus), muscle aches, and severe headaches, separated by weeks or months of no symptoms. About half of affected individuals may also experience long-term abnormalities of the nervous system that come and go, such as seizures, double vision, abnormal reflexes, paralysis of a cranial nerve (paresis), hallucinations, or coma. The exact cause remains unknown, although recent data suggests that herpes simplex virus (HSV-2 and, less frequently, HSV-1) may cause some, if not most cases. Other potential causes include trauma and viral infections other than herpes simplex [medquad_ans_0004105-1].

Most cases go away on their own without treatment. [medquad_ans_0002796-1]

**Question**

What are the genetic changes related to Senior-Lken syndrome ?

**Answer**

Mutations in one of at least five genes are associated with Senior-Lken syndrome. The proteins produced from these genes are known or suspected to play roles in cell structures called cilia, which are involved in signaling pathways that transmit information between cells. Mutations in these genes likely lead to problems with the structure and function of cilia, disrupting important chemical signaling pathways within cells. However, it remains unclear how these defects specifically lead to nephronophthisis and Leber congenital amaurosis. In some cases, no mutations in these five genes are identified, and the genetic cause of the disorder is unknown [medquad_ans_0000896-3].

**Question**

Do you have information about Genetic Testing

**Answer**

Yes, there is information about genetic testing. Genetic testing can cost anywhere from less than $100 to more than $2,000, and health insurance companies may cover part or all of the cost. Testing cannot tell you everything about inherited diseases; for example, a positive result does not always mean you will develop a disease, and it is hard to predict how severe symptoms may be. Geneticists and genetic counselors can explain what a particular test will or will not tell you and help decide whether to undergo testing. Some people may feel emotional reactions such as guilt, anger, anxiety, or depression upon learning results. Additionally, concerns about genetic discrimination exist, but the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) of 2008 protects individuals from discrimination by health insurance providers or employers, though it does not apply to long-term care, disability, or life insurance.

What is (are) capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation syndrome ?

**Answer**

Capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation syndrome (CM-AVM) is a disorder of the vascular system characterized by capillary malformations (CMs), which are composed of enlarged capillaries that increase blood flow near the surface of the skin. These malformations appear as multiple small, round, pink or red spots on the skin, typically on the face, arms, and legs, and may be visible at birth or during childhood. While capillary malformations alone usually do not cause health problems, some individuals with CM-AVM also have more serious vascular abnormalities such as arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs), which are abnormal connections between arteries, veins, and capillaries affecting blood circulation. These abnormalities can lead to complications including abnormal bleeding, migraine headaches, seizures, and heart failure, some of which can be life-threatening. Complications of AVM

**Question**

What is (are) Neutral lipid storage disease with myopathy ?

**Answer**

Neutral lipid storage disease with myopathy is a condition in which fats (lipids) are stored abnormally in organs and tissues throughout the body. The accumulation of fats in muscle tissue leads to muscle weakness (myopathy). This condition is caused by mutations in the PNPLA2 gene, which impairs the function of the adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) enzyme, resulting in the inability to break down triglycerides into fatty acids for energy use. As a result, triglycerides accumulate in muscle and other tissues. The condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning both copies of the PNPLA2 gene in each cell are mutated, and affected individuals typically have parents who carry one mutated gene but do not show symptoms. Other features may include a fatty liver, cardiomyopathy, pancreatitis, hypothyroidism, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The signs and symptoms vary greatly among affected individuals,

**Question**

What is (are) Hashimoto thyroiditis ?

**Answer**

Hashimoto thyroiditis is an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system attacks the thyroid gland, leading to damage of thyroid cells and a subsequent shortage of thyroid hormones. This occurs when white blood cells called lymphocytes accumulate abnormally in the thyroid and produce antibodies that destroy thyroid cells. The resulting deficiency in thyroid hormones disrupts body functions such as growth and development. It is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in the United States and affects 1 to 2 percent of people, occurring more frequently in women than in men, possibly due to hormonal factors. The condition is thought to result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors, including variations in genes within the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex and other immune-regulating genes, as well as potential triggers such as viral infections, changes in sex hormones, medications, ionizing radiation, and excess iodine intake. People with Hashimoto thyroiditis also have an increased risk of developing other autoimmune disorders

In specific cases, such as Lenz microphthalmia syndrome, mutations in at least two genes on the X chromosome are thought to be responsible, with only the BCOR gene currently identified. The BCOR gene provides instructions for making a protein called the BCL6 corepressor, which helps regulate the activity of other genes and plays an important role in early embryonic development. A mutation in the BCOR gene disrupts normal development of the eyes and other organs before birth [medquad_ans_0000593-3]. Additionally, microphthalmia may result from chromosomal abnormalities affecting one or more genes [medquad_ans_0000655-3]. Most genetic changes associated with isolated microphthalmia have been identified in only a small number of affected individuals [med
