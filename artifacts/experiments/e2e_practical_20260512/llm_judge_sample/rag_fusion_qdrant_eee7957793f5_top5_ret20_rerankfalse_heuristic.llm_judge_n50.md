**Question**

Who is at risk for Parasites - Taeniasis? ?

**Answer**

People at risk for taeniasis include those who eat raw or undercooked beef (particularly infected with Taenia saginata) or pork (particularly infected with Taenia solium or Taenia asiatica). Individuals in under-developed communities with poor sanitation, especially in Latin America, Eastern Europe, sub-Saharan Africa, India, and Asia, are at higher risk. Additionally, people in the United States, particularly Latin American immigrants, may be at risk due to consumption of raw or undercooked pork. Those who do not practice good hygiene and may contaminate their environment with tapeworm eggs (e.g., through fecal contamination) are also at risk for transmission, especially for T. solium infections that can lead to cysticercosis [medquad_ans_0000397-1\_\_dup2][medquad_ans_0000397-2__dup1].

**Query ID:** `0000775-1`

**Question**

What is (are) paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria ?

**Answer**

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is an acquired disorder that leads to the premature death and impaired production of blood cells. It affects red blood cells (erythrocytes), which carry oxygen; white blood cells (leukocytes), which protect the body from infection; and platelets (thrombocytes), which are involved in blood clotting. The disorder affects both sexes equally and can occur at any age, although it is most often diagnosed in young adulthood. People with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria experience sudden, recurring episodes of symptoms (paroxysmal symptoms) that may be triggered by stresses on the body, such as infections or physical exertion. During these episodes, red blood cells are prematurely destroyed (hemolysis), leading to hemoglobinuria—dark-colored urine due to the presence of hemoglobin. In many, but not all cases, hemoglobinuria is most noticeable in the morning. The premature destruction

What is (are) Colorectal Cancer ?

**Answer**

Colorectal cancer is cancer of the colon or rectum, which are parts of the large intestine. It occurs when malignant tumors form in the lining of the large intestine, also called the large bowel [medquad_ans_0000010-10]. The risk of developing colorectal cancer rises after age 50 and is common in both men and women [medquad_ans_0000221-1__dup2]. It can spread from its original location in the colon to other parts of the body, such as the liver, through the bloodstream or lymphatic system [medquad_ans_0000010-1__dup5]. Colorectal cancer accounts for almost ten percent of all cancer deaths in the United States [medquad_ans_0000010-1__dup5].

**Question**

What is (are) junctional epidermolysis bullosa ?

**Answer**

Junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB) is a type of epidermolysis bullosa, a group of genetic conditions that cause the skin to be very fragile and to blister easily. JEB is separated into two categories: the Herlitz type and the Non-Herlitz type. The Herlitz type is very severe and individuals with this condition often do not survive infancy. The Non-Herlitz type includes several subtypes that cause mild to severe blistering of the skin present at birth or shortly thereafter. JEB is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern and is caused by mutations in the LAMB3, COL17A1, or LAMC2, and LAMA3 genes. There is no cure for JEB; treatment is focused on managing blistering and preventing secondary infections [medquad_ans_0003317-1]. Both types of JEB

**Question**

What are the genetic changes related to molybdenum cofactor deficiency ?

**Answer**

The genetic changes related to molybdenum cofactor deficiency are mutations in the MOCS1, MOCS2, or GPHN gene. These mutations cause type A, B, or C of the disorder, respectively. Type A is caused by mutations in the MOCS1 gene, type B by mutations in the MOCS2 gene, and type C by mutations in the GPHN gene. These genetic mutations reduce or eliminate the function of the associated protein, impairing the biosynthesis of the molybdenum cofactor [doc_id: medquad_ans_0000668-3].

**Question**

What to do for What I need to know about Erectile Dysfunction ?

**Answer**

To know about Erectile Dysfunction (ED), you should understand that it is when you cannot get or keep an erection firm enough to have sex. This may include situations where you get an erection sometimes but not every time, get an erection that does not last long enough, or are unable to get an erection at all [medquad_ans_0000219-11]. An erection occurs due to increased blood flow into the penis, involving hormones, blood vessels, nerves, and muscles working together [medquad_ans_0000219-11]. ED often has multiple causes, and many diseases can damage nerves, arteries, and muscles [medquad_ans_0000219-11].

To determine the cause of ED, your doctor may take your medical and sexual history, ask about your mental health, perform a physical exam, test your blood, conduct a nighttime erection test, perform an injection

Timothy syndrome is associated with an altered CACNA1C gene, where one copy of the mutated gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder [medquad_ans_0000983-4]. Most cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in individuals with no family history of the disorder. Less commonly, individuals inherit the altered gene from an unaffected parent who is mosaic for a CACNA1C mutation, meaning the parent has the mutation in some cells, including egg or sperm cells, but not in all [medquad_ans_0000983-4].

**Question**

What are the genetic changes related to Senior-Lken syndrome ?

**Answer**

Genetic changes related to Senior-Lken syndrome include mutations in one of at least five genes. These genes are associated with the production of proteins that play roles in cell structures called cilia. Mutations in these genes likely lead to problems with the structure and function of cilia, which are involved in cellular signaling pathways. Defects in cilia are believed to disrupt important chemical signaling within cells, contributing to the features of the disorder. However, it remains unclear how these defects specifically lead to nephronophthisis and Leber congenital amaurosis. In some cases, no mutations in these five known genes are identified, and the genetic cause remains unknown [medquad_ans_0000896-3].

**Question**

Do you have information about Genetic Testing

**Answer**

Yes, I have information about genetic testing. Genetic testing involves taking a small sample of blood, saliva, or tissue to examine a person's genes. It can detect genetic disorders and is available for thousands of conditions. Genetic tests are used for various purposes, including identifying genetic diseases in unborn babies, determining if individuals carry a gene that could be passed to their children, screening embryos for disease, testing adults before symptoms appear, making a diagnosis in someone with symptoms, and determining the best type or dose of medicine for a person. Test results can provide relief by reducing uncertainty, help doctors make treatment or monitoring recommendations, support decisions about personal and family health, encourage preventive actions such as earlier screenings or lifestyle changes, and assist in making future life decisions like family planning. However, test results can also have emotional impacts, such as fear, guilt, anger, anxiety, or depression, and the cost of testing can vary from less than $100 to higher amounts

What is (are) capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation syndrome ?

**Answer**

Capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation syndrome (CM-AVM) is a disorder of the vascular system characterized by capillary malformations (CMs), which are composed of enlarged capillaries that increase blood flow near the surface of the skin. These malformations appear as multiple small, round, pink or red spots on the skin, typically on the face, arms, and legs, and may be visible at birth or during childhood. While capillary malformations alone usually do not cause health problems, some individuals with CM-AVM also have more serious vascular abnormalities such as arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs). AVMs and AVFs are abnormal connections between arteries, veins, and capillaries that can lead to complications including abnormal bleeding, migraine headaches, seizures, and heart failure, some of which can be life-threatening.

What are the complications of Prostate Enlargement: Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia ?

**Answer**

The complications of prostate enlargement, specifically benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), include narrowing of the urethra and urinary retention, which is the inability to empty the bladder completely. As the prostate enlarges, it presses against the urethra, pinching it and impairing urine flow. This can lead to a thickened bladder wall and, eventually, bladder weakness that results in incomplete bladder emptying, leaving some urine in the bladder [medquad_ans_0000208-1__dup4]. These issues contribute to the many problems associated with BPH [medquad_ans_0000208-1__dup4].

What is (are) Neutral lipid storage disease with myopathy ?

**Answer**

Neutral lipid storage disease with myopathy is a rare condition in which fats (lipids) are stored abnormally in organs and tissues throughout the body. This abnormal accumulation leads to muscle weakness (myopathy) due to fat buildup in muscle tissue. Other possible features include a fatty liver, weakened and enlarged heart (cardiomyopathy), inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), reduced thyroid activity (hypothyroidism), and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The condition is caused by mutations in the PNPLA2 gene, which results in impaired function of the adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) enzyme, leading to reduced breakdown of triglycerides and their accumulation in tissues. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, and there is currently no treatment to correct the underlying metabolic problem. Management focuses on dietary guidelines and symptom-related treatments; a recent study suggests potential benefit from bezafibrate for lipid accumulation and fat oxidative

The illness associated with Zika virus infection is usually mild, with symptoms such as fever, rash, joint pain, and conjunctivitis, which typically last for several days to a week. In rare cases, Zika virus infection has been linked to serious birth defects, including microcephaly and other brain anomalies, as well as Guillain-Barre syndrome. There is currently no vaccine or medicine to treat Zika virus infection, and prevention measures include avoiding mosquito bites, postponing travel to affected areas, and taking precautions for sexual transmission [medquad_ans_0006546-1][medquad_ans_0000981-1__dup1].

Wolman disease is a rare inherited condition involving the breakdown and use of fats and cholesterol in the body (lipid metabolism). It is a type of lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the LIPA gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The condition leads to a buildup of lipids in body organs such as the spleen, liver, bone marrow, small intestine, adrenal glands, and lymph nodes, along with calcium deposits in the adrenal glands. Infants are typically healthy at birth but soon develop symptoms including enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), poor weight gain, low muscle tone, jaundice, vomiting, diarrhea, developmental delay, anemia, and poor nutrient absorption.

What are the symptoms of Gout ?

**Answer**

The symptoms of gout include swollen, red, warm, and stiff joints. Attacks usually occur at night and can develop in a day, producing a swollen, red, and warm joint. Gout often affects joints in the lower part of the body such as the knees, ankles, or toes, and may specifically involve the big toe. Other signs and symptoms include hyperuricemia (high levels of uric acid in the body), the presence of uric acid crystals in joint fluid, more than one attack of acute arthritis, and arthritis that develops in a single joint [medquad_ans_0000028-13][medquad_ans_0000028-8][medquad_ans_0000409-1__dup1].
